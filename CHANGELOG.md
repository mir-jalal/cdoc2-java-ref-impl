# Changelog

## [1.4.0] Key label formatting (2024-09-02)

### Features

* Support for [machine-readable KeyLabel format](https://open-eid.github.io/CDOC2/1.1/02_protocol_and_cryptography_spec/appendix_d_keylabel/)
  - When encrypting, then this formatted key label is enabled by default. Can be disabled by setting `ee.cyber.cdoc2.key-label.machine-readable-format.enabled=false` system property (`-D`)
  - When decrypting, then both formatted and unformatted key label field versions are supported.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix cdoc2-cli encrypting functionality for SymmetricKey (`--secret` parameter). Bug was introduced with 1.1.0 release
  - Rewrote symmetric key (secret) and password handling in cdoc2-cli/cdoc2-lib
  - Bumped cdoc2-lib major version to `2.0.0`, as broken classes (`FormattedOptionParts`) were removed and replaced with a new ones (`LabeledPassword` and `LabeledSecret`)
  - cdoc2-lib was not broken, when using `EncryptionKeyMaterial#fromSecret(SecretKey,String)` directly (without `FormattedOptionParts`)
  - broken example cdoc2 files were removed from `test/testvectors` and replaced with a correct ones
* Fix cdoc2-client ApiClient timeouts (`cdoc2.client.server.*-timeout` were not working)
* Allow loading [pkcs11 (smart-card) test properties](README.md#pkcs11-tests) from file system (previously only classpath was working)

### Internal

* Third-party dependency updates to latest
* Added GitHub workflows for building and releasing
* Resolve issues reported by SonarCloud/SonarQube
* Update client and server certificates used for unit-tests. Add scripts for future updates

## [1.3.0] '/key-capsules' OAS v2.1.0 support (2024-07-02)

### Features

* Support for '/key-capsules' OAS v2.1.0 in cdoc2-client and cdoc2-cli (added `-exp`  option)
* cli: Improvements to interactive password asking (Don't ask password twice for decrypt).
  Label is not required, when CDOC2 file contains single password recipient.
* Add example project to demonstrate usage of cdoc2-java-ref-impl with cdoc4j (convert cdoc -> cdoc2)

## [1.2.0] Repository split and maintenance (2024-05-30)

### Features

* Expose Prometheus metrics endpoint for servers

### Internal

* Split repository into cdoc2-java-ref-impl and cdoc2-capsule-server
* Upgraded Spring 2.7.5 -> 3.2.5 + other third-party dependency updates

* Fix jacoco test coverage reports (broken previously)
* Add gitlab CI build files
* Added scripts for making releases and managing versions (see VERSIONS.md)
* Refactoring required to build cdoc2-capsule-server repo without cdoc2-lib dependency (cdoc2-lib dependency is still needed for running tests )
* Upload/consume cdoc2-key-capsule-openapi.yaml as maven artifact
* Added bats tests to check backward compatibility of CDOC2 format with previous releases

### Bugfixes

* With rename cdoc20-cdoc2 salts values were also incorrectly changed. Broke backward compatibility. Fixed before release 1.2.0
